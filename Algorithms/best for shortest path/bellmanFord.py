# It allows us to find the shortest path between two nodes of a weighted graph(means that it can accomodate the weight an edge has).
# One plus thing that this algorithm has above Dijkstra is that it accomodates negative weights, but at the same time it is slower than Dijkstra.
# time complexity O(n^2).
